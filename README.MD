# Sorghum Pan-Transcriptome Project

This repository contains the files and data related to the construction of the sorghum pan-transcriptome. The project aims to explore the transcriptome of sorghum and analyze its genetic diversity and functional elements.


## Project Structure
#The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **assemblies**: Contains assembled transcriptome data for different sorghum genotypes.
- **busco**: Data and scripts related to BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) analysis.
- **busco_plots**: Visualizations and plots generated from BUSCO analysis.
- **distance_based_inflation_eval**: Scripts and data for evaluating inflation values based on distance metrics.
- **domain_based_inflation_eval**: Scripts and data for evaluating inflation values based on domain annotations.
- **orthofinder**: Files and scripts related to OrthoFinder, used for orthogroup inference.
- **PANZZER2**: Tools and resources for functional annotation.
- **pantranscriptome**: Output files and data related to the constructed sorghum pan-transcriptome.
- **pfam**: Data and scripts for Pfam domain analysis.
- **snakemake**: Workflow scripts or configuration for Snakemake, a workflow management system.
- **transrate**: Data and scripts for transcriptome quality assessment using TransRate.
- **transrate_plot**: Visualizations and plots generated from TransRate analysis.
- **transdecoder**: Tools and resources for transcriptome CDS and proteins.
