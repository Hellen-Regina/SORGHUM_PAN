# Sorghum Pan-Transcriptome Project

This repository contains the files and data related to the construction of the sorghum pan-transcriptome. The project aims to explore the transcriptome of sorghum and analyze its genetic diversity and functional elements.

## Directories

The repository currently includes the following directories:

### Assemblies

The `assemblies` directory contains the assembled transcriptome data for sorghum. This includes the assembled contigs, transcripts, or any other relevant files generated during the transcriptome assembly process.

### Transdecoder

The `transdecoder` directory contains the output files generated by Transdecoder, a tool used for identifying potential coding regions within transcripts. This may include the predicted coding sequences (CDS), protein translations, and related files.

## Usage

This repository serves as a central location for storing and sharing the code, data, and results of the sorghum pan-transcriptome project. You can browse the directories to access specific files or download the entire repository for further analysis.
